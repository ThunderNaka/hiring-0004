- React Hook Form
- Yup
- Material UI
- Axios
- React hot toast

I used typescript because I wanted to avoid errors and ensure a type-safe environment for development.
I used NextJS because the use of that framework improves the performance and have built in features like the pages folder that save time when developing.
I used RHF because it is one of the standard on the industry when it comes to managing forms and Yup provides a way to ensure validation for that form
I used Zustand because it provides and easy way to manage global data and even persist the information with the session storage.
